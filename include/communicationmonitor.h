///
/// Provides a simple mechanism to track communication state for an entity,
/// and manage the associated alarm reporting. 
///
/// If the monitor detects that all comms are failing over a set_confirm_sec
/// interval, an alarm active state is requested. Once alarmed the monitor
/// will check for a successful comm. at a clear_confirm_sec interval. Once
/// one is detected, an alarm clear state is requested. Note that timing is
/// driven by calls to the inform_* methods. As such the intervals will not
/// be very precise at low call volume.
