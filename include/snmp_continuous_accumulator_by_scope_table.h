// This file contains the interface for tables which:
//   - are indexed by time period and scope (node type)
//   - accumulate data samples over time
//   - report a count of samples, high-water-mark and low-water-mark
//   - report mean sample rate and variance as weighted by the proportion
//         of time active within the time period
//   - carry across final value as initial value for the next table
//
// The thing sampled should be a continiuous data set, i.e. valued across a
// time period.
//
// To create an accumulator table, simply create one, and call `accumulate` on it as data comes in,
// e.g.:
//
// ContinuousAccumulatorTable* token_rate_table = ContinuousAccumulatorTable::create("token_rate", ".1.2.3");
// token_rate_table->accumulate(2000);
