// This file contains the interface for tables which:
//   - are indexed by time period
//   - accumulate data samples over time
//   - report a count of samples, mean sample value, variance, high-water-mark and low-water-mark
//   - reset completely at the end of the period
//
// The thing sampled should be event related, i.e. size of a queue, latency
// values
//
// To create an event accumulator table, simply create one, and call `accumulate` on it as data comes in,
// e.g.:
//
// EventAccumulatorTable* bono_latency_table = EventAccumulatorTable::create("bono_latency", ".1.2.3");
// bono_latency_table->accumulate(2000);
