// This file contains the interface for tables which:
//   - are indexed by IP address and IP address type
//   - report a count for each IP address
//
// It also contains the interface for their rows.
//
// To use an IP count table, simply create one, call `get` on it to create appropriate rows, and
// call `increment` or `decrement` on those rows as necessary:
//
// SNMP::IPCountTable* xdm_cxns_table = SNMP::IPCountTable::create("connections_to_homer", ".1.2.3");
// xdm_cxns_table->get("10.0.0.1")->increment();
// xdm_cxns_table->get("10.0.0.2")->decrement();
//
// IPCountRow objects are automatically created when needed, but need to be explicitly deleted (with
// `remove`):
//
// xdm_cxns_table->remove("10.0.0.1");
