// This function is responsible for managing Diameter connections to a

//
// We maintain several lists in this function. Here we describe the
// flows in this function and how these lists are used. These can be
// cross referenced with the numbered comments below.
//
// 1. Call resolve to perform a DNS resolution on the given realm and
//    populate targets with a list of potential peers to connect to. This
//    also returns a minimum TTL for the DNS entries.
// 2. Create a list of hostnames from the list of targets. This is
//    new_peers and it is used to compare hostnames with existing
//    connections.
// 3. _peers contains a list of the Diameter::Peer objects which
//    represent peers that we have either connected to, or which
//    we are currently trying to connect to. Filter this list on
//    existing connections into connected_peers.
// 4. If we have too many connected_peers (i.e. more than _max_peers),
//    remove some connections. We only remove connections to peers
//    that haven't been returned by the resolve function on this run
//    through.
// 5. Connect to any peers in the list of targets that we aren't already
//    connected to. This is how we can end up with too many connections
//    (as per step 4). We don't tear down any connections until we're sure
//    we have _max_peers connections. The only exception to this is
//    when resolve contains fewer than _max_peers entries which means we
//    sure we should have fewer than _max_peers connections.
// 6. Tell the stack the number of peers we are aware of, as, if the list
//    of peers is empty, any diameter requests issued through the
//    stack are going to have nowhere to go and will fail.  Inform the stack of
//    this situation so that it can make appropriate SAS logs on the call path
//    (the stack cannot make this determination itself by looking at its own
//    copy of the peer list as this is expected to be empty at other times -
//    only the Realm Manager knows if the underlying reason is that there were
//    no valid DNS records for the realm and no existing connected peers).
//
// On the first run through this function, a lot of this processing is
// irrelevant since we just get a list of targets and try to connect to
// them.
